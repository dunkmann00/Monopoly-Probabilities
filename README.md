# Monopoly-Probabilities
Simulate a Monopoly game to generate the probabilities of landing on each square.

While this project originally was inspired by
[Stand-up Maths](https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths) from YouTube, it
kind of grew into a way for me to play around with how to best share a python
project. I wanted to make it easy for someone who was not a developer/not
familiar with the command line, to be able to run this. Over time, this led me
down a rabbit hole that has culminated in the current version of this
repository. I'd love to continue to expand on this and add other ways to
package up a Python project. Each approach has its pros and cons, so it is
interesting (and useful) to try them out.
